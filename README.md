Water Quality Monitor - University of Surrey EEE3035 - Engineering Professional Studies - Group J Project - 2020/21

The files in this repository support the development of a water quality data logger, known as PONDER. It can measure temperature, TDS, Turbidity, and pH, and report data via bluetooth or GSM/GPRS.

This project is being developed by a team of eight students from the University of Surrey, as part of the Engineering Professional Studies EEE3035 module.
