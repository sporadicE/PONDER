# PONDER

PONDER is a remote water quality monitor built to support the UK's Clean Growth Grand Challenge. It is capable of autonomously measuring water quality indicators (temperature, TDS, turbidity, pH) and wirelessly reporting data via bluetooth or GSM/GPRS to a mobile Android application. 

This project was completed in 2021 as part of the EEE3035 Engineering Professional Studies module at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey.
